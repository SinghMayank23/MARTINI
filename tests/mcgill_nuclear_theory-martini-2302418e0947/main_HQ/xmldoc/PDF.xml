<flag name="PDF:useLHAPDF" default="on">
If off then the choice of proton PDF is based on <code>pPDFset</code>
above. If on then it is instead based on the choice of 
<code>LHAPDFset</code> and <code>LHAPDFmember</code> below.
<note>Note:</note> in order for this option to work you must have 
compiled PYTHIA appropriately and have set the <code>LHAPATH</code> 
environment variable to provide the data-files directory of your local 
LHAPDF installation. See the README file in the PYTHIA <code>examples</code> 
directory for further instructions.

<word name="PDF:LHAPDFset" default="cteq5l.LHgrid">
Name of proton PDF set from LHAPDF to be used. You have to choose 
from the 
<a href="http://projects.hepforge.org/lhapdf/pdfsets" target="page">
list of available sets</a>. Examples of some recent ones would be 
cteq61.LHpdf, cteq61.LHgrid, cteq6l.LHpdf, cteq6ll.LHpdf, 
MRST2004nlo.LHpdf, MRST2004nlo.LHgrid, MRST2004nnlo.LHgrid and 
MRST2004FF3lo.LHgrid. If you pick a LHpdf set it will require some 
calculation the first time it is called. 
<note>Technical note:</note> if you provide a name beginning with a 
slash (/) it is assumed you want to provide the full file path and then
<code>initPDFsetM(name)</code> is called, else the correct path is assumed 
already set and <code>initPDFsetByNameM(name)</code> is called.
</word> 

<modeopen name="PDF:LHAPDFmember" default="0" min="0">
Further choice of a specific member from the set picked above. Member 0
should normally correspond to the central value, with higher values
corresponding to different error PDF's somewhat off in different 
directions. You have to check from set to set which options are open.
</modeopen>

<flag name="PDF:NuclearEffects" default="on">
Include nuclear effects (on) or not (off, for pp).
Requires PDF:useLHAPDF to be "on".
